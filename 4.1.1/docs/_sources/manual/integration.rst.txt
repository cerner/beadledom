beadledom-integration
=====================

Overview
--------

Beadledom Integration is a submodule that runs tests for an example service running behind a reverse-proxy.

Currently tests exist for the ``Forwarded Header``. This could later be expanded to provide tests for any ``ContainerRequestFilter`` or ``ContainerResponseFilter``.
