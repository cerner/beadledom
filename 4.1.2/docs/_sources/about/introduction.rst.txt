Beadledom
=========

A simple, composable framework for building `RESTful <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_ services.

Beadledom takes many best in class components from the Java ecosystem and composes them together
in a lightweight and modular way to enable consumers to quickly and easily build robust ReSTful services.

Providing a single entry point into a service as well as a consistent way of bootstrapping components to make
it is easy for consumers to configure existing and/or install additional functionality. Beadledom's bootstrapping
and configuration relies heavily on `Google Guice <https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Motivation>`_ so if
you aren't familiar with Guice it is highly recommended you spend a few minutes and read over their introductory
documentation.

  Used as the glue and bootstrapping components

Jackson:
  JSON serialization/deserialization
