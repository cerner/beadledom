# Releasing Beadledom

The [Preparing for the Release](preparing-for-the-release) section is needed only for the initial setup. If the setup is already made once, skip to [Release process](release-process)

## Preparing for the Release

* A valid Sonatype user account is required to release this project. To create an account sign up with [Sonatype](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa).
* Execute the following commands in your terminal to prepare travis-ci
    
    ```
    $ cd /path/to/beadledom
    $ gem install travis
    $ travis login
    #  Prompts you to enter github username, password and two-factor authentication if enabled.
    $ travis enable -r <username>/<repository>
    <username>/<repository>: enabled :)
	```
* Install `gpg2` - we will be using this tool to automatically sign off our artifacts
	* install it via brew - `brew install gpg2`. There are other ways to install this tool but doing it via brew can help us all to be in sync with the version of the tool we are using.
	* Follow this [guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html#generating-a-key-pair) to generate your own gpg key and secret.
	* Choose a password to encrypt the public and private keys that were generated in the previous step using gpg2. Execute the below steps to encrypt the keys.
	
	```    
    $ export ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=<password to encrypt>
    $ openssl aes-256-cbc -pass pass:$ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD -in ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg -out .travis/secring.gpg.enc
    $ openssl aes-256-cbc -pass pass:$ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD -in ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg -out .travis/pubring.gpg.enc
	```
* All the secrets and passwords must be encrypted and passed on to travis as [secured environment variables](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-encrypted-variables-in-.travis.yml).
 
	```  
    $ travis encrypt --add -r <username>/<repository> SONATYPE_USERNAME=<sonatype username>
    $ travis encrypt --add -r <username>/<repository> SONATYPE_PASSWORD=<sonatype password>
    $ travis encrypt --add -r <username>/<repository> ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=<password to encrypt>
    $ travis encrypt --add -r <username>/<repository> GPG_KEYNAME=<gpg keyname (ex. 1C06698F)>
    $ travis encrypt --add -r <username>/<repository> GPG_PASSPHRASE=<gpg passphrase>
    ```   
* Create a new set of ssh keys to push the documentation site to `gh-pages` branch. Follow this github [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key) to create the ssh keys.
	* **Note**: The ssh keys file names has to be `deploy_site`.
	* Before generating the keys make sure the current directory is the directory where all your ssh keys are stored. By default this would be `~/.ssh`
* Add the contents of `deploy_site.pub` to the [beadledom deploy keys](https://github.com/cerner/beadledom/settings/keys).
	* *pro tip*: You can copy the contents using `pbcopy < path/to/deploy_site.pub`
* Encrypt the `deploy_site` key and add it to .travis.yml file by executing the below commands.

	```
	$ cd path/to/beadledom
	$ travis encrypt-file ~/.ssh/deploy_site --add
	``` 
* Commit all the changes to the beadledom repo.
 
## Release process

After preparing the project for the release follow the below steps

* Update the changelog with the release data for the releasing version.
* Commit the change.
* Prepare the project for releasing.

    ```
    mvn clean release:prepare
    ```
    The below command will prompt for the release version. Give the same version as in the changelog. After that it also prompts for the next development version. Give the appropriate version number for the next release.

* Push the local commits and tags

    ```
    git push origin master
    git push origin --tags

    ```

If at anytime the release need to be stopped. Cancel the maven commands and run the below command

```
mvn release:rollback
```

Once the master branch and tags are pushed the following happens.

* Travis starts a new build for released tag pushes the artifact to Maven central. It roughly takes about 2 hours for the artifacts to sync with the maven central.
* Builds the documentation site for the released tag and publishes it to `gh-pages`.
* Travis starts another build for the current snapshot and pushes the artifacts to [sonatype snapshots repo](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/cerner/beadledom/).

To monitor the build go to [beadledom travis-ci builds](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/beadledom/builds).
